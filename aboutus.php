     <center><u><h1>WHAT WE DO</h1></u></center>

     <p class="para"> Finding the perfect home tutor in KPK is not only 
     	difficult but also involves a lot of research and a 
     	lot of phone calls to home tutoring service providers. 
     	With this platform we are trying to solve the problem of 
     	hiring a home and online tutor in KPK.
     
Parents can now search a tutor for their children 
with a single click. We have a list of qualified tutors 
who are all at least graduation degree holders or have at
 least 5 years of teaching experience. Before we 
 allow any tutor to enlist on our platform, we conduct a
  background check on them that includes phone number, cnic,
   qualification and experience verification.</p>
